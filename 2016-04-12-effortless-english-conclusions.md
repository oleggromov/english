# Effortless English test-drive

A week ago I decided to try Effortless English method of learning, the listening routine which is one of its parts in particular. The goal was to figure out if the method is powerful and interesting enough to be practiced (and to decide to buy the course or not). I listened to the AJ Hoge webinar about culture and the method itself for 5 or 6 times basically during my commute to work (by car or subway). I made the following observations:

- listening to the natural English speech is at least interesting
- it helps me to catch and understand almost invisible parts of English prononciation sounds
- it is very uncomfortable to do sport routines together with listening to audio-lesson because the latter is almost missed
- the listening itself is not enough to learn and master new phrazes, words, meanings
	- I should also read the text, grab new idioms and meanings, write them down and speak (IMPORTANT!)

The truth is **I didn't try the most part of the method:**

- stories with different points of view (from past, present and future tenses)
- listen-and-answer stories
- mastering phrazes and mentioned above preparatory work

## Conclusion

I definitely have to add listening excercises to my English learning process. The goal is to decide what to listen and how to master this material.
