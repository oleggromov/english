### Effortless English

[Conclusion](./2016-04-12-effortless-english-conclusions.md)

The AJ Hoge idea is simple and, maybe, powerful. He says one should learn English by listening to the natural speech, not by reading (as long as he wants to learn how to speak), especially not by reading textbooks with synthetic phrases and dialogues. He wants about $40 a month for online membership in his courses, so I'd like to test his approach before joining.

As far as I remember, the main idea was to learn *deeply* by listening the same lesson (let it be a webinar, audio book in English or something similar) repeatedly during a week to understand even the slightest detail in the speech. He claims this approach works well and gives much more understanding and confidence. Especially when the vocabulary used by the speaker is well-known by the listener.

So I'd like to try this approach. I try to start with listening to his [webinar about culture and learning English](http://effortlessenglishclub.com/culture-english-speaking-webinar) and check if it is interesting and clear enough for me. If yes, I'll continue listening for the next week and then look at the results.
