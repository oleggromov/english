Today I understood that LinguaLeo is probably not the best option for learning English. This is because of strict boundaries in learning words and not well-done learning mechanics.
For example, grammatics module is rather useless because rules are presented in Russian, like a page from a textbook. Nevertheless, the process of listening, understanding and repeating words and phrases is very helpful itself so I decide to continue until will find any more appropriate learning method.
