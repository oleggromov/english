# Melinda Gates on Time Economy

There is a second part of the article in which Melinda Gates argues why it is important to understand that women all over the world can be more effective and more happy by just having their homework done with a less effort and with help of men. Melinda has three princnipal points on that:

- everybody should understand that the unpaid home chores are also a kind of work
- we should also invent on that by making techonolgical improvements more affordable for the women and families all over the world
- men ought to share this work with women because one gets both benefits and drawbacks from taking those duties.
