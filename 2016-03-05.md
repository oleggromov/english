I've started learning using LinguaLeo — it's a great and very helpful service filled with plenty of tasks of different types. I don't have any learning plan by now but definitely realize that learning English is very important (and LL makes it fun) and very interesting. I've chosen the highest possible level of learning intensity and the biggest possible level of language acquaintaince and found that it's not too big burden for me.

So the first lesson consist of:

- new words (vocabulary)
- some videos in English (Simple commands, U.S. Customs)
- two crosswords of being learnt words
- an unsuccessful attempt of taking IELTS course (or its replica)

## Vocabulary

**Hold on!** means to wait, i.e. "Please hold on for a minute while I'll take you a cup of tea."

## Passing U.S. customs

It's important to have all forms completed (`I-94`) in plane, passport, tickets, hotel address etc. up to the moment of passing the border. It's better to be relaxed and anwer all questions quickly and in the most accurate way. Most of the questions are standard:

- what is your final destination?
- how long will you stay in U.S.?
- what is the purpose of your visit?
- where will you be staying?
- how much currency are you carrying?
- who packed your bags? any gifts?
- do you have anything to declare?

### TODO
Check the U.S. Customs website in order to understand what should be declared and what not.
